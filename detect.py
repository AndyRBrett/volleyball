"""Subject detection: turn raw clip frames into tracking data (the CV front-end).

This is the stage that was missing -- the reason the pipeline had "processed 0
frames ever". Everything downstream (highlights.py, coaching.py) consumes
*tracking* data; nothing produced it from actual pixels. This module closes that
gap with deliberately small, dependency-free detectors so the pipeline can be
proven end-to-end in CI without ffmpeg, opencv, torch, or a GPU.

It reads a clip stored as a gzipped sequence of Netpbm P5/PGM frames (see
fixtures/make_reference_clip.py) and recovers the per-frame *subject point* the
rest of the pipeline tracks. Two detectors, picked by the active domain:

  * ``brightest_blob`` (volleyball) -- the subject is the ball, found as the
    centroid of the brightest blob in each frame.
  * ``motion_energy`` (martial arts) -- there is no ball; the subject is the
    fighter, found as the centroid of pixels that *changed* since the previous
    frame. Quiet moments produce no motion, so they read as gaps between
    exchanges -- the direct analogue of a ball going out of play.

Either way, frames with no subject yield a null position -- exactly the signal
highlights.segment_rallies uses to split continuous play into segments. The
per-frame position is stored under the ``ball`` key for schema stability across
the pipeline; read it as "the tracked subject point" (the ball in volleyball,
the fighter in martial arts).

The output schema matches the tracking JSON the rest of the pipeline already
expects (see highlights.py), with ``width``/``height`` added so the coaching
heatmap knows the surface dimensions, and ``domain`` recording which sport ran.
