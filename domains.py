"""Sport domains: make the CV pipeline switchable across volleyball / martial arts.

The pipeline is mechanically domain-neutral. It tracks a single *subject* point
per frame, segments play from gaps in that point's motion, tags each segment
from timed events, and bins events onto a *surface* grid. What actually differs
between sports is:

  * how the subject is found in the pixels (a bright ball vs. a moving fighter),
  * the action vocabulary used as coaching tags,
  * the words used in the human-facing report, and
  * sensible segmentation thresholds.

A :class:`Domain` bundles exactly those differences so every other module can
stay generic and just ask the active domain. Select it with the
``COACHVISION_DOMAIN`` environment variable or a ``--domain`` CLI flag. The default
is volleyball, which preserves prior behaviour and the overseer's existing
machine-readable status contract (``segment_count``, ``frames_processed``, ...).

Why these two detectors?
------------------------
Volleyball has an obvious high-contrast subject -- the ball -- so a brightest
-blob centroid is an honest, dependency-free detector. Martial arts has no ball;
the subject is the fighter, and the signal that "play" is happening is *motion*.
The standard dependency-free approach is motion-energy temporal segmentation:
threshold the frame-to-frame pixel difference and take the centroid of what
changed, so the tracked point follows the action and quiet moments read as gaps
between exchanges. See domains' ``motion_energy`` detector in detect.py.
