"""Generate the bundled martial-arts reference clip used by the pipeline self-test.

The volleyball reference clip proves the brightest-blob detector; this one proves
the *motion-energy* detector that martial arts uses (there is no ball). Like its
volleyball sibling it is a short sequence of grayscale Netpbm (P5/PGM) frames,
gzipped, decodable with only the standard library -- no ffmpeg/opencv/GPU.

Key difference: the subject (a bright "fighter" disc) is visible in *every*
frame. What signals play is whether it is *moving*. During an exchange the
fighter sweeps across the mat with a striking bob; between exchanges it freezes
in place. ``detect.detect_motion`` thresholds the frame-to-frame difference, so a
frozen fighter produces no motion and reads as a gap -- exactly the signal
highlights.segment_rallies uses to split play into exchanges.

Outputs (committed as fixtures, regenerate with ``python make_martialarts_clip.py``):
  martialarts_clip.pgm.gz       -- gzipped P5/PGM frame sequence (the "clip").
  martialarts_clip.events.json  -- ground-truth martial-arts events bundled with it.
